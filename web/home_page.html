                2 / 16 / 17 : <br>Still trying to get Elrath's Journey completed. In the mean time, I have started a Budgeting Web App. The idea came from my wife and I talking about how we need to budget our money better, so I have started this app to help ourselves and anyone who needs it a chance to budget their money better. The app is called Budgeting Made Easy.
